Description

The OR operator (represented as ||) allows a script to proceed if at least one of multiple conditions is met. Unlike the AND operator, which requires everything to be perfect, the OR operator returns True if any single part of the expression is true.

Think of it like a guest list: you can get into the party if you have an invitation OR if you are on the VIP list.
