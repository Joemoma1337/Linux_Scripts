#The switch construct is another powerful feature offered by Linux bash scripts. It can be used where nested conditions are required, but you donâ€™t want to use complex if-else-elif chains. Take a look at the next example
echo -n "Enter a number: "

case $num in

echo "Hundred!!" ;;
200)
echo "Double Hundred!!" ;;

echo "Neither 100 nor 200" ;;
